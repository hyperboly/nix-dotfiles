# NixOS Dotfiles
Current configuration only supports 1 host for my laptop.
Planning to add more for servers in the future (hopefully).

Hyper specific on what hardware it wants, just copy snippets of my config don't actually use it if you don't want to heavily modify it.
This is not a configuration for general hardware.
